NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Debug - display information about the current
    request/response

SYNOPSIS
        # app.psgi

        use Plack::Builder;

        my $app = sub {
            return [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/html' ],
                   [ '<body>Hello World</body>' ] ];
        };

        builder {
            enable 'Debug';
            $app;
        };

DESCRIPTION
    The debug middleware offers a configurable set of panels that displays
    information about the current request and response. The information is
    generated only for responses with a status of 200 ("OK") and a
    "Content-Type" of "text/html" and is embedded in the HTML that is sent
    back to the browser.

    To enable the middleware, just use Plack::Builder as usual in your
    ".psgi" file:

        use Plack::Builder;

        builder {
            enable 'Debug' qw(DBITrace PerlConfig);
            $app;
        };

    If you pass a list of panel base names to the "enable()" call, only
    those panels will be enabled. If you don't pass an argument, the default
    list of panels - Environment, Response, Timer and Memory - will be
    enabled.
